Optimal sequence (total = 17 minutes)

1.A and B cross → 2 minutes (A,B on far side; C,D on near side)
Total so far: 2

2.A returns → 1 minute (A back; B on far side)
Total so far: 3

3.C and D cross → 10 minutes (C,D on far side; B waiting there; A on near side)
Total so far: 13

4.B returns → 2 minutes (B back; C,D on far side)
Total so far: 15

5.A and B cross → 2 minutes (A,B join C,D on far side)

Total final: 17 minutes

Reasoning:

A and B ferry first (A+B go, A returns), then C and D go together, then B returns — cost = A + 2*B + D.

Method cost = 1 + 2*2 + 10 = 15 

Add the initial crossing needed to set up this Method (A & B cross first for 2), and the final crossing (A & B cross again for 2). The whole-plan arithmetic leads to total 17; any alternative plan ends up at least 17 or worse. Thus 17 is minimal.
