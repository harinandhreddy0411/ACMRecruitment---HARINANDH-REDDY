1.Each term is the product of two consecutive numbers:

𝑎n= n*(n+1)
1*2=2
2*3=6
3*4=12
4*5=20
so the next two terms are :
5*6=30
6*7=42
(30,42)

2.The difference between the numbers is also following a pattern we can also find them through this :
6-2=4
12-6=6
20-12=8
30-20=10
42-30=12
so the next two numbers are : 30,42
