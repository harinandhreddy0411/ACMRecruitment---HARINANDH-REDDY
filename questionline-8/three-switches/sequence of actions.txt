Steps:

1.Label the switches A, B, C.

2.Turn A ON and leave it on for ~3â€“5 minutes.

3.After that time, turn A OFF and immediately turn B ON.

4.Walk into the room with the bulb (only one entry allowed).

How to tell which switch is which

1.If the bulb is lit, then B controls the bulb (B is currently on).

2.If the bulb is dark but warm to the touch, then A controls the bulb (A was on long enough to heat it, then turned off).

3.If the bulb is dark and cold, then C controls the bulb (it was never turned on).
